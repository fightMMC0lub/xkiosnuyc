| Phase                         | Description                                                                                   | Example Activities                                              |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Pre-engagement Interactions | Define scope, goals, legal permissions, and expectations                                     | Scoping calls, contracts, rules of engagement                   |
| 2. Intelligence Gathering      | Collect information about the target from public and open sources                            | WHOIS lookups, OSINT, social media profiling                    |
| 3. Threat Modeling              | Identify likely threats and attack paths based on gathered intel                             | Mapping attack surface, identifying valuable assets             |
| 4. Vulnerability Analysis       | Find weaknesses and security flaws in systems and applications                              | Vulnerability scanning, manual analysis                         |
| 5. Exploitation                 | Actively exploit found vulnerabilities to gain access                                       | Exploiting misconfigurations, privilege escalation               |
| 6. Post-Exploitation             | Assess the value of compromised systems and maintain access                                | Pivoting, data exfiltration, persistence setup                  |
| 7. Reporting                     | Document findings, impact, and recommendations                                              | Creating reports, debriefing stakeholders                       |
